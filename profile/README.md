The NHS England Tools organisation is a robust collection point for our open-source projects and code snippets. It's designed to promote best engineering practices, and ensure a uniform architecture across our services, strictly adhering to the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/blob/main/README.md) guidelines. This rich resource provides a plethora of reusable components, comprehensive CI/CD building blocks, and clearly outlined blueprints accompanied by their implementation examples. Our commitment to knowledge sharing and expertise exchange led to the establishment of this organisation. By inviting feedback on our work and welcoming different perspectives on our chosen methodologies, we hope to mutually enrich the broader community.
