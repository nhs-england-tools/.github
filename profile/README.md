üè¢ The NHS England Tools organisation is a robust collection point for our open-source projects and code snippets. It's designed to promote best engineering practices and ensure a uniform architecture across our services adhering to the [Software Engineering Quality Framework](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/blob/main/README.md) guidelines.

Our extensive suite of assets (there is more to come!) includes a multitude of reusable components, comprehensive CI/CD infrastructure elements and blueprints. These elements serve not merely as tools but as catalysts for the accelerated development and success of your initiatives.
