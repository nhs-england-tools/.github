This NHS England Tools organisation serves as a repository for our open-sourced projects and code snippets, aimed at fostering good engineering practices and harmonising architecture across the services, which are aligned to the guidelines of the [Engineering Quality Framework](https://github.com/NHSDigital/software-engineering-quality-framework/blob/main/README.md). This resource offers reusable components, CI/CD building blocks, blueprints and their usage examples. Established with the purpose of sharing our knowledge, expertise and tools, we aim to benefit the wider community by receiving feedback on our work and gaining additional insights into the chosen approaches.
